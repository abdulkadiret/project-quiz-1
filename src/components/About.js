        <strong>About CYF Quiz Project</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>Hello, and welcome to CYF quiz web app, so glad you're here.</p>
      <p>
        We are a group of graduates from CYF bootcamp, and decided to create
        this application based on our experience as previous students to the
        course, and as a graduates who are looking to give back to CYF
        community. This app will help students to test their knowledge about
        each given syllabuses, by taking each related quiz. With this app, we
        aim to encourage our students to take new challenges, and build on the
        confidence to try new thing every time. It is also a testament for us
        the developers to present a valuable product that has been actively
        benefiting the current students.
      </p>
